RULES FOR DECLARING VARIABLE
......................
Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
Can contain letters, digits (0-9), and underscores, but cannot start with a digit.
Case-sensitive: age, Age, and AGE are different variables.
Cannot be a Python keyword (e.g., True, False, if, for, class, etc.).
no need to declare any variable like (int, float, string)
No Explicit Declaration: Just assign a value, and Python will automatically create the variable
